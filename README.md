ðŸ†–ðŸ†™

Discord bot designed as part of the [Sahar](https://wiki.conworkshop.com/w/Main_Page) collaborative workbuilding project.

Its functions include:
- `!ngupname`: generate a personal name in a [Ngerupic language](https://wiki.conworkshop.com/w/Ngerupic_languages)
- `!kwat`: roll the dice in a game of [kwat](https://wiki.conworkshop.com/w/Kw%C4%85t) (unfortunately the bot does *not* keep track of how many tokens players or the pot have)
- `!semshift`: use the [semshifter](https://github.com/rowanjacobs/semshifter) web scraping API to generate potential meaning shifts from a target word
- `!reverse`: use the semshifter API to generate potential etymologies for a target word
